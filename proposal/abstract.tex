\chapter*{Abstract}

A course of research is proposed which advances theory and practice in
predictive control systems software. The benefits of modern software techniques,
such as functional and functional-reactive design patterns will be evaluated in
the development of a reusable framework for parallel, distributable,
research-grade model predictive control systems in modern C++. The work will be
validated by the production of novel research in the field of control systems
theory. Prior work which lead to this, is described along with a review of
relevant literature and theoretical background in optimal control.
