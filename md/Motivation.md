# Motivation


Floyd 1979 Turing award lecture

> I believe that the current state of the art of computer programming reflects inadequacies in our stock of paradigms, in our knowledge of existing paradigms, in the way we teach programming paradigms, and in the way our programming languages support, or fail to support, the paradigms of their user communities.

This quote feels quite relevant now, but it comes from Robert Floyd's 1979 Turing award lecture. Floyd uses the word paradigm as frames of thinking to solve problems. It is up to the programmer to select the frame of thinking that suits their problem. The answer is not a single paradigm to solve all problems, but in understanding how the paradigms can fit together to solve complex problems.

C++ failed to support Functional paradigm, until recently.


Want to use functional programming because it provides abstractions to make programming easier for better algorithms. But we want to use C++ because this is the language most directly related to hardware that provides minimal abstractions for functional patterns.
