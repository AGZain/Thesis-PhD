# Functional Programming for the Intrepid

## Lecture 1: Intruduction to, *and* Motivation *for* Functional Programming.

* While functional programming isn't a new concept, it has recently gained popularity as a solution to some of the most difficult problems faces in software engineering today. Namely, the problems of concurrency and complexity management.

* The foundational ideas in Functional programming date back from when programming was a task for mathematicians, and has been largely developed as a subdiscipline of mathematics and computer science.

* The heritage in mathematics makes the topic unapproachable for many because much of the literature is written for acadmeics and is not generally accessible to the working programmer.

* In the title, I target the intripid programmer, who wants to understanding the software concepts, but also to have a working understanding of the background. This is not going to be mathematically rigorous, but I will include enough mathematics to allow the viewer to think creatively using the abstractions of functional programming using the underlying category theory, type algebra and lambda calculus.

### Why functional programming?



### Currying and Functional Dependency Injection

I appreciate your perspective, +Dally W, but I think it's lacking a bit of proportion. The "good liberals" are the vast majority of us: we just don't get the news coverage. The narrator in the video was careful to point out that it was a couple of hundred students that ruined the university for several thousand.  Neglecting to recognise that proportion is to commit the same crime as the left wing media does, when they caricatures the entire right with footage extreme right-wing nutbags. Perfectly reasonable right-wing thinkers suffer a terrible bias because the loud-mouth crazies get the air time. I think we need to STOP doing this to eachother and return to a left/right dialectic, rather than dismissive, tribalistic identity politics that allows us to dehumanise eachother.
