## [awgn/Cat](https://github.com/awgn/cat): C++14 functional library

Features on review:
  * Currying

## [beark/ftl](https://github.com/beark/ftl): C++ template library for fans of functional programming

Features on review:
  * Currying
  * Concepts
  * Category theoretical traits and interfaces


#### Currying

A general currying mechanism is provided in `prelude.h`. However, that header
only provides an interface. The support for curried functions comes from a
`std::function`-like type-erasure wrapper specified in `function.h`. The
documentation therein claims that the main difference between an `stl::function`
and `std::function` is the support for curried calling.

The STL library has an interesting trait: `is_monomorphic`, which

## [Dobiasd/FunctionalPlus](https://github.com/Dobiasd/FunctionalPlus): helps you write concise and readable C++ code.

This library is associated with a [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/functional-programming-using-cpp/) that has two [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jD8Tu1tqvZo) available for preview. I haven't taken the course, but this library is publicly available.

Features on review:
  * Function composition
  * Currying
  * Function traits
  * Intermediate value elision in the `fwd` namespace. (Is it lazy?)
  * [Gradient decent algorithm](
    https://github.com/Dobiasd/FunctionalPlus/blob/master/include/fplus/optimize.hpp)

#### Function composition



#### Currying
The library contains no general currying facilities. The `curry.hpp` header file contains *macro functions* which produce hard coded, nested lambdas for currying functions of up to 5-parameters. Some sort of script generates curried instances of all of the multary library functions. Each library function contains a formatted comment specifying the number of parameters to be bound for currying purposes. For example, in `numeric.hpp` there is a function called `clamp`. In the function definition, there is a line
```
// fwd bind count: 2
```
which gets translated by a script into the line
```
fplus_curry_define_fn_2(clamp)
```
which is placed in `curry_instances.autogenerate_defines`, which gets expanded with the macro:
```cpp
#define fplus_curry_define_fn_2(fplus_curry_define_fn_2_name) \
template <typename P1> \
auto fplus_curry_define_fn_2_name(P1 p1) \
{ \
    return [p1](const auto& fplus_curry_p2) \
    { \
        return [p1, fplus_curry_p2](auto&& fplus_curry_p3) \
        { \
            return fplus::fplus_curry_define_fn_2_name(p1, fplus_curry_p2, \
              std::forward<decltype(fplus_curry_p3)>(fplus_curry_p3)); \
        }; \
    }; \
}
```
which is defined in `curry.hpp`.

I don't consider this a viable implementation of curry semantics for exposure to users, and it clearly wasn't design to be.

In my library, I want to avoid macros, and I don't want the user to have to specify the number of arguments they will need, unless currying a variadic function.

## [fons/functional-cpp](https://github.com/fons/functional-cpp): functional programming in cpp.

#### Notes:
  * Very strange that list-monad/functor are implemented for `std::list` and `std::forward_list`, but not vector!
  * Uses `std::function` and `std::bind` in functor and monad implementations
  * `map` defined in `map.hpp` for `std::forward_list` uses insert_front.

Features on review:
  * list-monad
  * list-functor

#### List-functor

In `functional-cpp/src/map.hpp` functor-maps for `std::list` and `std::forward_list` are defined. The functor itself is fleshed out in `functional-cpp/src/functor.hpp`, where `fmap` simply forward to `map` from `map.hpp`.

For some reason that I can't figure out, there are `map` overloads for both `std::forward_list` and `std::list` on whether or not the type `B` in `f : A â†’ B` is deduced or specified as a template argument. If `B` is specified, a hand-rolled loop is used to apply the function to the elements, but if it is deduced `std::transform` is used. Strangely enough, the case where `B` is specified for the `std::forward_list` uses `std::function` in the signature instead of templatising on the callable type.

In the map functions, lists are passed by reference and callables are copied. It doesn't look like a lot of thought went into value/reference semantics.

## [christianparpart/compose](https://github.com/christianparpart/compose): Functional Programming in C++14

This presents a really nice API for composing functions:
```cpp
#include "compose.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  auto v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};

  auto range = compose(v)
                   .map([](auto x) { return x * x; })
                   .select([](auto x) { return !(x % 2); })
                   .take(3);

  for (auto a: range) {
    std::cout << "a: " << a << std::endl;
  }
}
```

## [splinterofchaos/io-monad-function.cpp](https://gist.github.com/splinterofchaos/3994038) (Gist)

This code doesn't compile, but I was fascinated by it on cursory reading. I suspect I will draw inspiration from it, if not valid code. (However, I suspect most of the code is quite valid, but I have to figure out why it isn't compiling before I can be sure.)


I Suspect the IO monad here will be the same as in splinterofchaos/Pure.
