* The standard library has functional-ish interface (passing in lambdas). There are very few classes meant to be derived from. Very few virtual or pure virtual members. "It seems the committee has forgotten how to object-orient the standard library."

* Object-oriented programming doesn't have solutions to important problems, such as
  - the composition of algorithms,
  - truly generic programming, without dependency issues, and
  - management of complexity in concurrent software.

* C++ is often thought of as O-O, but FP is not about language features, it's about a mental model for thinking about code. Aside: I like using Floyd's definition of paradigm for this purpose.

* C\++11 and C++14 introduce a number of language features which enable and ease the writing of FP abstractions.

* C++ lambas introduce no overhead.

* Limitations of lambas in C++11:
  - The couldn't have generic arguments. (That is, a templated `operator()`.)
  - Couldn't capture variables with move semantics. Only by copy or reference. (So, no unique pointers)
  - Anonymous type could not be named, so lambas could not be returned froma function!

* C++14 gives us lambdas with:
  - generic arguments,
  - automatic return type deduction, and
  - generalised capture lists.

Using `std::function` for type-erasure introduces overhead, but not more than any other language supporting lamdas.

* Functional style and higher order combinators are possible in C++ with things like lambdas, automatic type deduction, etc.

* C++ presents challenges sith copy/move semantics, perfect forward and alike.

* Libraries to reduce headaches: Boost.Fusion, Boost.Hana, Fit.

* Composition in this way was not possible in C++11 for lack of deduction:
  ```
  template <typename F> auto compose(F f) {
    return [=](auto x) { return f(x); };
  }

  template <typename F, typename... Fs> auto compose(F f, Fs... fs) {
    return [=](auto x) { return f(compose(fs...)(x)); };
  }
  ```

* Boost.Hana is cutting edge, and functional in nature. (Types cannot be mutated.) It provides a number of nice combinators.

* Boost.Hana allows currying in `hana::curry()`:
  ```
  auto f = curry([](int x, int y, int z) { return x * y * z; });

  auto s = f(4);
  auto t = f(5);
  auto 2 = f(6); // w = 26
  ```

* Overloaded function object, not possible in most functional languages:
  ```
  auto f = hana::overload( // T.T. call f doubleIt(.);
    [](std::string s) { return s + s; },
    [](auto        x) { return x * s; }
    );

  std::vector<T> v = ...;
  std::transform(begin(v), end(v), begin(v), f);
  ```

* Partial application for binary operators:
  ```
  // Another version of doubleIt:
  using hana::_;
  std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};
  std::transform(begin(v), end(v), begin(v), _ * 2);
  ```

* Infix function application:
  ```
  std::sort(begin(v), end(v), [](int i, int j){
    return std::abs(i) > std::abs(j);
  });
  ```
  we write
  ```
    std::sort(begin(v), end(v), (_ < _) ^on^ &std::abs<T>);
  ```
  Apparently the `Fit` library has something similar.
    - Prefer function objects, which are easier to pass around:
      ```
      auto abs = [](auto x){ return std::abs(x); };
      std::sort(begin(v), end(v), (_ < _) ^on^ abs);
      ```
    which instantiates the template for `std::abs<T>` in the lambda. I worry about performance here.

* Fix point combinator, which apparently has many nice theoretical properties:
  ```
  auto fact = hana::fix( [](auto fact, auto n) -> int {
    if (n == 0)
      return 1;
    else
      return n * fact(n - 1);
  });
  ```
  Apparently the fixpoint combinator factors the recursion.

* Interesting point: `std::tuple` is a product type and `std::optional` is a sum type for algebraic construction of types. Other sum types: `boost::variant`, `expected<T,E>`.

* Inheritance hierarchies may seem to cover the same uses cases as sum types. but they're actually opposites. [1h3m](https://youtu.be/SCC23W3CQc8?t=1h3m)
  - Class hierarchies support a *fixed* set of operations over an *open* range of possibilities.
  - Sum types support an *open* set of operations over a fixed range of possibilities.
  - T.T. I think this means that in type algebra, the set of possible values is fixed: ints are ints, and so on. Many operations can be defined on them, and abstraction allows us to deal with how to operate on the sum and product types composed from the set. In the case of classes, the virtual members form a fixed set of operations, while inheritance allows us to complicate the set of possible values by creating children with more and more data components.
  - Investigate the statement: "Each time you apply the Visitor Pattern, you probably need a sum type."

* Languages with abstract data types usually support pattern matching. No universal way in C++. `boost::variant` offers something similar for product types.  `std::optional::value_or()` simulates it on optionals. Stroustrup comes close with a library called Mach7.

* [Criticism of exceptions](https://youtu.be/SCC23W3CQc8?t=1h5m59s)â€”Fast on non-exceptional execution paths, but slow-to-throw. They ugly-up the code and are trivially ignored, which is a common source of bugs.

* A nice term: lawful abstraction. Abstractions, like monads and monoids which are tied to laws.

## Audience questions

  * Q([31:36](https://youtu.be/SCC23W3CQc8?t=31m36s)): You've passed lambdas and functions by value. Wouldn't it make sense to perfectly forward them?
    - A: Yes, of course. I've chosen to make the code simple by omitting std::forward everywhere. In the std library, there is a convention to pass lambdas by value, since they are stateless most of the time, and nothing is copied anyway. The `std::ref` and `std::cref` wrappers are useful for forcing pass reference.
